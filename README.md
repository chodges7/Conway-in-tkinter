### Intructions to run it yourself:
* Download the conway.py file (by doing a `git clone...` or downloading from the repo
* use the command `$python3 conway.py` or any command that runs python 3.0 or higher
* That's it!

### Want to make the board bigger/smaller?
All you have to do is change the `dimension` variable on line:11 to be bigger or smaller.  
Be warned that a bigger board means that the program will run slower.
